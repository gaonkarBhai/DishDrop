<!-- # DishDrop 🍔🛵

Welcome to DishDrop, the most innovative food delivering web app that will make your taste buds go wild! 🎉

## Features

- 🍽️ Add delicious food items to your cart and satisfy your cravings.
- 💰 Seamless billing system that magically makes your money disappear (just like that final piece of pizza! 🍕).
- 🚫 No actual food delivery because who needs real food when you can enjoy the digital experience? Virtual calories are the best! 😄

## Technologies Used

- 🌐 **ReactJS**: The JavaScript library that powers DishDrop's delightful user interface. It's like the secret spice that makes our app so tasty!
- 🍃 **MongoDB**: The database where we store all the imaginary food items. We take your taste buds on an imaginary journey!
- 🔒 **Login & Signup**: Experience the thrill of creating an account and logging in, even though we won't really remember who you are. It's like a game of hide and seek!
- 🎟️ **JWT Token**: We use super-secret JWT tokens to authenticate you and ensure only the chosen ones can access our imaginary food. Top-secret, just like Area 51! 👽
- 🔐 **bcryptjs**: Our passwords are like secret recipes - we hash them using bcryptjs so that not even our developers can figure them out. They're locked away like treasure chests! 🏴‍☠️
